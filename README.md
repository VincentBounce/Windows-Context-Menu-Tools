## Updated 2024-03-17

Bundle of best ***Windows File Explorer tools that supercharge context menu*** sorted and organized in cascaded menus.

- All tools are **based on Windows 10-11🪟 built-in commands🎛️ only**.
  - No additionnal running service.
  - No more memory consumption.
  - Offline installation without `.exe .msi .inf`, no file copied, so garanteed virusfree.
- The `.reg` files are adding entries into Windows Registry when you install these tools.
  - Instant installation.
  - Each tool can be installed separately.
- We recommend optional upgrades like [PowerShell 7 x64 MSI] or [Windows Terminal], because these open-source projects are pushed by *Microsoft*, and will be probably built-in next releases of Windows.

  - need to hold `Shift` while right-clicking on a folder
  - or right click on a folder then *Show more options*
  - or follow [these instructions](#-windows-11-new-context-menu) to remove/restore this Windows 11 extra layer

# ![wipe-free-space-icon] Overwrite deleted data - Drive shredder

![Wipe-free-space-screenshot](/readme-images/Wipe-free-space-screenshot.png "Overwriting D:\ drive from Windows File Explorer")

- Secures all your external drives before giving them, by ensuring that all **deleted data** has been **overwritten**. Usually, even if a file is deleted and not just moved to *Recycle Bin*, this file is just **deindexed**, and entire content remains totally **recoverable** from your disk, until this content is overwritten by another file. This reason explain why deletions are so fast.

- To secure your disk without formatting, this tool calls the Windows built-in program `cipher.exe` which writes successively 3 big files to fill entire empty space, in a temporary file (`D:\EFSTMPWP\filE6A3.tmp` for example). Of course, it **keeps existing files**.

- Avoids traditional formatting, which is unsecure, and which erase unnecessarily the files you want to keep.

- Executes 3 writing sequences: a first one only with `0` bits, a second one only with `1` bits, and a third one with random bits.

- Applies on all internal and external drives, displayed in both *File Explorer* left and right panes.

- To use it, right click on your external drive → *Overwrite deleted data*. When process is done, you'll see 3 full lines of 100 points each one, like screenshot above.

💿 To install this tool separately, just run `TOOL_Shredder-Wipe-free-space.reg` and confirm 3 dialog boxes. To install [bundle it's here](#-install-all-tools).
