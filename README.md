# Windows Context Menu Tools

![Screenshots](/readme-images/WindowsContextMenuTools-screenshots.jpg "Screenshots of Windows Context Menu Tools")

This repository is a bundle of best ***Windows shell File Explorer context menu tools*** sorted and organized in cascaded menus.

- All tools are condensed in command-lines **using only Windows 10-11 built-in internal commands**.
- These commands are written into Windows Registry when you install these tools.
- No `.exe` nor `.msi` nor `.inf` to install it.
- We recommend optional upgrades like [PowerShell 7 x64 MSI] or [Windows Terminal], because these open-source projects are pushed by *Microsoft*, and will be probably built-in next releases of Windows.
- On **Windows 11**, an extra step is necessary to use these tools: from File Explorer, right click on selected item âžœ *Show more options*. Or select item âžœ `Shift` + `F10`

> Tested on Microsoft Windows 10/11 Pro 64-bits.
